Plot_Sandbox
===========

This sandbox develops the capabilities of the GNUplot
program.  It serves as a template to quickly generate
various plots from a pre-existing framework.  To run
the script, type the following in the terminal:

      gnuplot MultiPlot

and a sample .png file will be generated called 
'MultiPlot.png'.  To incorporate this into a C
program, simply call 

      system("gnuplot ScriptName")

from within the C code.
