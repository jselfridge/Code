VSIPL_Sandbox
=============

This set of code serves as a snadbox for implementing the 
Vector Signal and Image Processing Library (VSIPL) which 
allows for linear algebra functionality within the C 
programming language.  This capability will be incorporated 
into "SampleSim" which is the sandbox program for developing 
Matlab-like capabilities within a C language.
